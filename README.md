# Rolo
### rollable pattern puzzle

Back in 2008 I used to play a game with the same name (Rolo) developed by GetApp, but the game is gone from the AppStore since forever, so I decided I could develop the same game in JavaScript, of course I was wrong, but I had friends who liked the concept of the game and helped (meaning they coded) it. lipe coded most of the base of the game while in a call with me and I could watch him type everything because we used the jsfiddle feature COLLABORATE which allowed us to see and code on the same file at the same time, we stayed up until 2am when the game was playable. The next morning I showed the game to my 5yo son, and he tried to play using only the arrows keys, so I changed the keybaord shortcuts to be playable with only the arrows keys, since in the beginning the idea was that the WSAD keys would select row/col and the arrow keys would shift the circles, and he really liked the game, which inspired me to stick to it and try to improve it. I spend the entire next day working on it to improve code and add some features, including a "Congrats" screen.

The game is in its first release (0.0.1alpha), but its playable, at least.

Still need improvements, maybe a timer, a ranking, someday. Who knows?

Thanks to lipe for putting up to me until 2am, [@fabioars](https://github.com/fabioars) for insisting that I try to code something in JavaSciprt (will get there), [@lucasmedi](https://github.com/lucasmedi), [@airstrike](https://github.com/airstrike).
